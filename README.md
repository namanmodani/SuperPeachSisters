# Super Peach Sisters

Super Peach Sisters is set in the Mushroom Queendom, fictional land of crazy creatures  like fire-breathing piranhas, koopas and goombas. Unfortunately, Mario is taken hostage by the evil greenhouse gas producer named Yerac Grebnehcan (who is well known for producing huge amounts of methane), and Peach must face a number of increasingly difficult levels to rescue him.
